# Challenge Week

Challenge Week is an annual Friday-to-Friday period, kicking off with an afternoon group event that sets a problem before a group of programmers and sees them working in pairs to solve it within a given time limit. The primary purpose of this event is to encourage people to tackle a novel problem with a partner that they may not have worked with before, or may not have worked with in a pair-programming context specifically. After the kickoff, the remaining week gives time for individuals to create specialised solutions for the problem in friendly competition for a small set of awards.

## Project Leadership

There are 3 designated organisers & arbitrators for the event, with varying levels of involvement. The intent behind this structure is to minimise the time required by senior resources, while still providing a support structure to the primary organiser and preventing decision impasses.

### Primary Arbitrator

Serves as the primary event organiser, problem designer, and judge for solution submissions. This person is expected to perform all possible organisational duties within their power, requesting assistance from external operational resources where necessary.

### Secondary Arbitrator

Serves as a secondary problem designer and an equal judge for solution submissions. This person is not expected to perform organisational duties, but is required to be present at the kickoff event.

### Tertiary Arbitrator

Serves as a tie-breaker for any organisational or judging decisions which require one. This person need only have minimal participation in the event that is required, and need not be present for the kickoff event.

## Structure

The structure of challenge week is as follows:

### Kickoff Event

#### Intro & Problem Overview

*Duration: 15 minutes*

Get familiar with the problem

#### Challenge Round 1

*Duration: ? minutes*

Pair program in C# or Go, find a working solution.

#### Break

*Duration: 15 minutes*

Eat, drink, change pairs.

#### Challenge Round 2

*Duration: ? minutes*

Find a new partner, program an Javascript/Typescript or Python, find a working solution.

#### Outro

*Duration: 15 minutes*

Mingle, discuss.

### Individual Submissions

*Duration: 1 week*

On your own, in your own time, write the most optimised solution you can. Do your best not to depend on AI for the algorithm, but using one for finding language features or more optimal patterns is okay.

To make a submission, fork the repository, add a new directory within the year that you're submitting with your name, and use that directory to keep the source code and any docs for your solution. So, for example, if your name is "Joe" and you're submitting a solution for the 2025 problem, you'd fork the repo, and in the `2025/` directory, you'd create a directory called `joe/` (you can use whatever your preferred name is, just ensure that it doesn't conflict with another contributor's directory name and that you are identifiable). Please include a `README.md` in your directory for any additional information pertaining to your solution, such as instructions for running the solution. You can then create a pull request back into the upstream repository for your code to be reviewed.

## Awards

The final algorithm challenge will be assessed by a few different metrics, so you can lean into the thing that interests you the most. The awards are:

- **The Hacker**: The working solution with the fastest performance benchmark (with the year's defined benchmark process).
- **The Golfer**: The working solution with the fewest characters (sans tests).
- **The Poet**: The working solution with the most beautiful source code (as agreed upon by the year's designated arbitrators).

What constitutes an award beyond just a title/recognition by peers is TBD in discussion with leadership.
